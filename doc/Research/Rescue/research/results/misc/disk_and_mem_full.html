<pre><font>Hi,
    I was wondering what happens if you are working on a Linux
system and get low on hard disk space memory or run out of space.
Does the system give you a warning message, do programs freeze or
crash, etc?
                                                            Thanks

The swap partition is independant.  Mine is huge so I've never seen it run out
of space.

Elsewhere what you'll usually see is error messages from programs trying to
save a file or error messages about there not being any temp space (/tmp).
There's usually a small buffer;  file systems can get a little past 100% full.

m&gt; Hi,

m&gt; crash, etc?

Depends.  Generally, Linux won't crash, but if you have a pathological
process things can get hairy.

Normally, the Ext2  file system (which Linux uses as its native file
system), leaves 15% of the disk for root only -- this means that a user
process will get a 'disk full' error while there is still some disk
space available.  System daemons will still work and won't crash, etc. 
'root' can go in and attempt to deal with the full disk issues -- such
as gziping stuff (root has that 'spare' 15% to use to create temp files,
such as the compressed file gzip creates while compressing).  

If (virtual) memory runs out, you will not be able to create new
processes.  This can make it hard to 'kill' out-of-control processes
(since you won't be able to run the ps or kill commands).  There is a
'trick' to create this situation, something called a 'fork bomb'.  I
believe Linux and most modern UNIX systems are able to survive a fork
bomb, but it is possible to write a fork bomb type program that could
get past the various safeguards.  Of course a fork bomb is
*pathological* by nature -- normal programms are not fork bombs (at
least they should not be).

Having said all of this, (and had problems which involved a kind of
slow-motion fork bomb -- I had problems with a script relating to some
FidoNet code and improper device locking), I have found Linux to be
very robust in the face of some really bad situations.  I had a '486
with only 16 meg of RAM and managed to create a sort of 'traffic jam'
of processes stuck because of problems with a cron job and a locked
device -- the cron job kept creating a new process that wedged on the
locked device, a new one every 15 minutes.  It did this overnight and
in the morning I found this 'mess'.  So long as the processes were just
waiting the system was actually running fine.  Just that ps was
spitting out lots of output and Netscape was pagefaulting more than
usual...  So it did a 'killall' on the processes and the system
started pagefaulting and became really, really 'busy' -- basically it
effectly was 'hung' for about 20 minutes while the system cleared out
all of the (wedged) processes.  Eventually, things cleared up and
everything returned to normal.  No crash or any other problems.  I have
since fixed the FidoNet cron job script to check the lock *before*
going after the serial port and if the lock is 'old', kills off the
'stuck' FidoNet job and generally cleans things up and so on.

m&gt;                                                             Thanks

<pre><font>Had this happen a while back - I wasn't maintaining my log files, and
the grew &amp; grew &amp; grew until my root parition was full.  The next time I
signed on as user and tried to launch X, it wouldn't work and gave me
all sorts of really unhelpful messages.  The errors I got made it look
like something was wrong with X itself, whereas the real problem was
that there wasn't enough space on the partition to create whatever temp
files (I guess) X and the environment needed to run.

Very confusing, I give it a 3 Hairs Pulled rating (out of 4) for Linux
Problems.

Can't recall where I got the notion to check the space on the disk, but
eventually I did and that's when I found that the root parition was 99%
full.  Cleaned out the logs, everything fired up as it should have after
that.
