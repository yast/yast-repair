Found this by searching for &quot;lost root password&quot; on the LDP at
&lt;URL:http://www.linuxdoc.org/&gt;:

1. Reboot (try [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[Delete]) 

2. During the LILO prompt type: (kernel/image name) init=/bin/sh rw
   ... note that's usually going to be just: linux init=/bin/sh rw

3. This should start the Linux kernel, with the root filesystem
   mounted in read/write mode. The cool thing is that none of your
   normal init processes (like the gettys that ask for your name and
   call the login program) will be started.

4. (Maybe) mount your /usr filesystem with a command like: mount /usr

5. Change your root password with a command like: passwd

6. Flush the cache buffers: sync; sync; sync

7. (Maybe) unmount /usr: umount /usr

8. Remount the root fs in readonly mode: mount -o remount,ro /

9. Let init clean up and reboot the system: exec /sbin/init 6 
   ... there is a &quot;6&quot; (six) at the end of that command.

If you are booting from a floppy made with mkbootdisk (which is
what makes it during installation), you should get a Lilo: prompt.
Enter
linux single
at the prompt.  There is a good chance this will let you boot
single user without having to enter a password.

Someone else suggested a somewhat more complicated method, which
included included mounting /usr and running passwd.  Since
the passwd and shadow files are in /etc, I don't see how that
would work.

Another method would be to use a rescue disk.   The RedHat 6.0
boot floppy allows you to enter rescue at the lilo prompt and
then asks you to insert a second rescue disk.  Some sites still
have RedHat 6.0 available and of course you may have the RH6.0
CD.  In that case you should find an image of the rescue disk
in the images directory.  You can copy it with NT or Windows
using the rawrite command which is also part of the distribution.
The rescue system provides you with a version of Linux running
in memory.  You can then mount the root filesystem which will
contain the passwd (also shadow if shadow passwords has been
enabled) and you can edit those files.  Unfortunately, it is
likely that the only editor available in this rescue system is
ed, which few people know how to use.  But it is not too difficult
to master, and you can experiment with it first.   All you have
to do is remove the password field from passwd or from shadow
if shadow passwords have been enabled.  For shadow, you first
have to change its permissions so it is a writable file.
Then after you reboot, you can use the ordinary passwd command
as root to set a new password.  

You can also try using Tom's root/boot disk, which also gives
you a system running in memory but has a wider choice of editors.

Many keep '/usr' on a separate partition (i.e. not on the boot
partition). The 'passwd' command usually lives within '/usr/bin'. You
can't run 'passwd' without mounting '/usr/bin'.

<pre><font>Help....I am running redhat 6.2 i386.  I was hacked and my root password
was changed.  I was able to boot to run level 1 and change the root
password to something else.  Now I can login as root using the password
I changed it to.  When I log directly into root it seems to work no
problem and allows me to do all the normal things root can do.
However if I do not initially login as root, I can not su to root, using
that password.  It says incorrect  password.  This happens whether I
su, su -, or su root.  Very wierd.  I am stumped?

Thanks

Quite likely the su program has been replaced by a password sniffer.
I hope you have your data backed up because the best thing to do now
is to wipe your installation and re-install.  And this time, do the
security updates and install portsentry before re-connecting to the
network.

Backed up from just before the cracker cracked your system, right?
Because afterwards, the data cannot be trusted. Juvenile crackers my
simply delete files, but the real nasties make just minor changes here

thanks for the replies. it took me quite a long long time to set this

&gt; system up how i want.  And I would rather not wipe my entire syste, are

Load new versions of your backup utilities from CD-ROM or the
distribution floppy and do a byte-for-byte compare of what is on your
system with your most recent backup tape made before the cracker got
it. Only works, of course, if you do frequent complete system backups. 

Why not just restore your system from your most recent backup made
before the cracker got in? But be sure you restore clean copies of
things like your kernel, cpio, etc., (whatever you use) from your
distribution media. Because you cannot really even trust your kernel
anymore. If the stuff on the distribution media is out of date, at
least it will be relatively secure. You can restore the more
up-to-date versions from your complete system backup. Then you might
dare get onto the Internet again and download all the latest security
enhancements for your distribution.

<font color="#990000">&gt; &gt;  &gt;Help....I am running redhat 6.2 i386.  I was hacked and my root password
&gt; &gt;  &gt;was changed.  I was able to boot to run level 1 and change the root
&gt; &gt;  &gt;password to something else.  Now I can login as root using the password
&gt; &gt;  &gt;I changed it to.  When I log directly into root it seems to work no
&gt; &gt;  &gt;problem and allows me to do all the normal things root can do.
&gt; &gt;  &gt;However if I do not initially login as root, I can not su to root, using
&gt; &gt;  &gt;that password.  It says incorrect  password.  This happens whether I
&gt; &gt;  &gt;su, su -, or su root.  Very wierd.  I am stumped?</font>
<font color="#007777">&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Quite likely the su program has been replaced by a password sniffer.
&gt; &gt; I hope you have your data backed up</font>
<font color="#660066">&gt;
&gt; Backed up from just before the cracker cracked your system, right?
&gt; Because afterwards, the data cannot be trusted. Juvenile crackers my
&gt; simply delete files, but the real nasties make just minor changes here
&gt; and there in your data.
&gt;
&gt; Another reason not to back up your data to another hard drive: the
&gt; cracker can screw up both, so you have nowhere from where to
&gt; restore... .
&gt;</font>
<font color="#007777">&gt; &gt; because the best thing to do now
&gt; &gt; is to wipe your installation and re-install.  And this time, do the
&gt; &gt; security updates and install portsentry before re-connecting to the
&gt; &gt; network.

thanks for the replies. it took me quite a long long time to set this
system up how i want.  And I would rather not wipe my entire system, are
there any other recommended alternatives?  Is there anyway to tell if
the data is safe or not?
