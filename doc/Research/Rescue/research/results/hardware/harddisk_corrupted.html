<pre><font>Hi all

I have a dual-boot Win98/Redhat Linux 6.1 system. Recently something
went weird with my Windows after downloading some software from the
internet (may have been coincidence or may have been a virus) and
suddenly, when booting into Linux, I was warned that I should use
e2fsck as there were errors on my boot partitions. I ran e2fsck on both
my partitions / and /usr (dev/hda6 and dev/hda7) and found a lot of
corrupt files, etc. Subsequently, I could boot into Linux OK, but if I
ran Netscape and it saved any temp gif files into its cache, the next
time I booted up again, it gave me similar errors again... it would
appear as if the system did not recognise a bad block on the drive and
kept trying to use it. However, I then used the badblocks cmd and
e2fsck again, and this time the fix seems to be permanent!

However, my Win98 partition is completely shot. I can't boot into it
even in Safe Mode as Scandisk (in DOS) keeps hanging interminably at
17% and it refuses to let me run Win.com. If I try booting the Win98
repair disk and doing the &quot;emergency repair work&quot; recommended,
including installing some key system files, will this somehow overwrite
my Master Boot Record (without warning, as Windoze tends to do most
things) and kill Lilo, hence rendering my Linux partition inaccessible?

Does anyone else have experience trying to fix their Windows on a dual-
boot partition without affecting Linux...?

Does this sound like a hardware problem or a virus in Windows? Can a
virus in Windows affect even the Linux partitions on the drive?

Help appreciated!
Thanks...
newbie Jin

Yep.  If you're worried about the MBR, go get yourself a boot disk.  I
happen to like Tom's ( http://www.toms.net/rb/ ) but that's just me.
Use a command like
   dd if=/dev/hda of=/somewhere/safe/ bs=512 count=1
to put your MBR somewhere safe, like on a floppy disk.  Do whatever you
need to do in Doze, then if the MBR is screwed up, you can recover it by
booting from Tom's or another boot disk, and doing
   dd if=/somewhere/safe of=/dev/hda

<font>
If the partition table is properly configured, Win/DOS cannot even see
any Linux partitions, let alone scribble on them.  There are not that
many Win/DOS programs that write to the raw disk--examples include
FDISK, FORMAT, Partition Magic, and Explore2fs.exe--and virus writers
are not that sophisticated in most cases.

It *might* be a hardware problem.  The expected life of a modern IDE
drive is 3 years; less for poor-quality/cheap drives.  Modern IDE drives
are supposed to map marginal sectors to a set of known good &quot;spare&quot;
sectors on the fly, without other hardware components even noticing.
Bad sectors only appear when the pool of known good spares is exhausted.
If badblocks is reporting any bad sectors at all, it might be time to
consider a new drive....

<pre><font>Be sure to check /var/log/messages for errors, errors logged
there should pinpoint the problem.

I'd guess your disk is failing, since adding badblocks fixed
the linux problem.

Unless you have a full backup of your windows partition, you are likely 
out of luck.

I had a (new) disk go bad recently - writes succeeded, and later
on, reads of the same block failed.

I had errors recorded in /var/log/messages, such as:

Sep 30 19:49:13 lin1 kernel: hda: read_intr: status=0x59 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest Error }
Sep 30 19:49:13 lin1 kernel: hda: read_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError }, LBAsect=1003539, sector=1003539
Sep 30 19:49:13 lin1 kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev 03:00 (hda), sector 1003539

My first symptoms were windows hanging (ends up the mailbox file
was corrupted, and any read of the file caused windows to hang),
and later windows hanging while booting (during scandisk).

I was able to boot linux. I didn't know about badblocks (I just ran
it today and found two bad blocks on a new drive), so I didn't run it, 
but I backed up all my files that I could (starting with windows), and 
this showed me what files were using the bad blocks (i.e. could not read 
the files and output an error).

Then, I scanned the entire disk using dd, and checked for log messages. 
This showed that there were many bad blocks (should have used badblocks).

Anyway ... this was a new drive, and I'd already backed up my old drive 
in order to copy to the new drive, so I got a new drive, re-installed 
all my windows files from my backup, and then overwrote newer files from
my latest backup (of the failing drive). I don't think I lost any critical 
linux files, but I still had to move everything to the new-er drive.

I'd suggest you backup whatever you can, figure out what files are
unreadable, and procede from there - perhaps a scratch install of 
windows followed by a recovery of any files you backed up, or just
restore to a new disk and try to boot from it.

Objection! :-)

In DOS there is *no* &quot;Protected Mode&quot;. The system calls to write to
random sectors at the disk are all there!

So it is *very easy* to write a virus that can ruin your Linux-Partition.
You could even do it from a &quot;Batch-File&quot; which calls &quot;Debug&quot;. :)

Pay close attention to temperature!
In many cases, drives that appear to be defective, are only overheated!
And yes, running a drive too hot can very well ruin it's low level format.

Good Luck,

Could very well be a bad partition table.
Could you post the result of 'fdisk -l /dev/hda' here?
