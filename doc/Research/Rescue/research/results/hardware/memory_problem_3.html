Good afternoon,
I have a problem.

When I tried to recompile my kernel yesterday, I had a &quot;signal 11&quot;
error. I did a &quot;make clean&quot; and tried again. This time, gcc stopped at a
file that had been compiled properly the first time, complaining about
&quot;msg_lerel&quot; being unknown (line 218 in /linux/kernel/printk.c of kernel
source 2.0.33). I looked at that file and it really said &quot;msg_lerel&quot;. I
changed that to &quot;msg_level&quot; and the kernel compiled without any
(apparent) problems. The date and time stamp of printk.c had not been
changed.

What's going on here? I assume gcc doesn't normally change source files
when compiling (gcc version is 2.7.2.3 BTW). So is this a hardware
defect? Is it the hard disk that is defective or could other components
cause random changes of bits or bytes on the disk as well? Could this be
associated somehow to power management? (I have the impression that
signal 11 errors occur on my machine when I enable HDD Power Down (or
however it's called) in the BIOS.)

I fear that I may never again be able to trust any kernel or program I
compiled, because other changes to source files may have passed
unnoticed. If a 0 is changed to 1, for instance, gcc probably won't
complain. So this is a really critical situation, right?

I hope somebody can point me to a possible cause of this problem or even
a solution.
Thanks in advance.

I have a suggestion for one explanation:  when you installed Linux on the hard
drive you were working on, did you have it do a thorough scan of the media
surface during the formatting process?  I know I am personally guilty of not
having done so....  It sounds like it could be the file is lying on a flaky
patch of the hard drive surface.  Just a possiblity, but your symptoms would
make sense then.

This is probably because of bad memory or bad cache-memory.

<font>
It's probably not the disk. If you have parity memory you could try to
enable parity check in you CMOS setup and watch out for messages like:

May 31 13:01:08 draken kernel: Uhhuh. NMI received. Dazed and confused,
but trying to continue
May 31 13:01:08 draken kernel: You probably have a hardware problem with
your RAM chips or a
May 31 13:01:08 draken kernel: power saving mode enabled.

If you get this kind of messages at leas one of your SIMMS could be
broken. It could also be some other kind of error giving this problem
like a broken motherboard. One way which might get around these problems
without really fixing them is to enable ECC in CMOS setup.

If you don't get these messages it could also be broken cache on the
motherboard or in the CPU. Try to disable the cache in CMOS setup and
see if this helps. Unfortunately you will lose performance by doing
this.

Enabling HDD power down is not good for your HDD.  Hard Disks experience
the most wear during spin up and spin down.  However, failing disks should
generate CRC error messages that would be reported by the kernel.  I would
suspect that your HDD controller, memory, or motherboard could be bad.

Well...

Linux is, like many other operating systems using memory for caching.
That means, while you are working with files, some of them, and/or
parts of them are worked with in memory. 
Later on they are written back to disk.

A Signal 11 error means, there is something wrong with your
hardware, most likely with your memory.

Thus it is very likely, that data being in memory, while the
error occurs is mangled somehow.

And finaly the mangled data may get written back to disk.

In most cases your problem is caused by ram, that is outof spec
(not fast enough for the rest of your system). 
If you make memory access a little slower, by i.e. putting in
an additoanl waitstate, it will usualy work. 
See the &quot;Signal 11 Faq&quot; for details.

Good Luck,
Friedhelm
