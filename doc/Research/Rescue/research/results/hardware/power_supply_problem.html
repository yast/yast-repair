<pre><font>I have an ABIT BP6 dual celeron 433Mhz.
384MB RAM
3950U2B SCSI controller. with 2 18 GB WD disk (lvd) and 9.2 IBM (lvd)

I have installed RH 7.0 with 2.2.18 SMP kernel.

the system was working fine for 1 week non stop.

then today it crashed. twice within 2 hours. there was no warning
message. The
system was essentially idle. no large jobs where running.

Is there a way to find out why s system that was essentially stable
crashes with no
warring. How can I debug that.

Any help will be appreciated.

Thanks

If the crashes occur after a specific length of idle time, make *absolutely*
sure that all the ACPI and APM features are disabled in both bios and SMP
kernel. 

Check your system logs for messages which might indicate problems
(/var/log/messages is a good place to start).

If it is a set of sporadic crashes resulting in power-off, then one likely
cause is a dying power supply - if the power-good line in the ATX connector
drops below 5v it forces a power off to protect the CPU from erratic voltage
swings.

<pre><font>APM and ACPI are disabled. I could not find any indication of a problem

the 5V range in the last 7 hours (while there was not crash) is
+4.72 - +5.24

Is it possible that it could be anything but a power supply, if so how can I
find
what cause the problem (can this be a CPU or motherboard problem).
can linux help in detecting the problem?

Thats out of spec - the 5V should not drop below 4.75v. However its not far out.

Take it from me, problem determination in this case is often a case of
suck-it-and-see. My system at home has been freezing up, crashing and being
generally wierd for about the last month. I've scanned the logs, and there are
a few strange entries, such as 'bad_slab_magic' (meaning corruption has
occurred) and 'oops' (the kernel hit something it didn't expect, like a bad
pointer). I've run memory tests and played around with the system extensively,
unplugging hardware and trying different software configs. Nothing clear
cut. The memory is good (or at least it is well behaved when the system is only
under light load).

If the system is powering off sporadically, that *often* means that the power
supply is dodgy. Memory corruption and crashes also point to a dodgy power
supply, but they can also be caused by bad memory. To test for bad memory, I
suggest you run a memory test tool for a few hours (memtest86 springs to
mind). 

If you are certain that APM and ACPI really are inactive (BIOS and software
config), and the system is still powering down randomly (and that really is key
- if its not random something is doing it on schedule) then you should at least
consider the possibility of a hardware problem. If you can get a suitable power
supply from a friend to swap with your own (make sure it is at least as
powerful as the one you currently have) it is definitely worth experimenting to
find out if this makes a difference. At the end of the day, a new 300W power
supply should not set you back more than US$50 and spares are always useful.

While this may not be your problem, there is a considerable amount
of folk lore on the web (which I think might be true) that some
revisions of the Abit BP6 motherboard have a manufacturing/design defect
where a weak power supply capacitor is installed on the motherboard.
I suspect that I have that problem (but my symptom is lockups,
not loss of power).  I think I have some of these boards, as per
	http://bp6.gamesquad.net/Q6fix.phtml
and	http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~doylep/linux-bp6/

The symptom I get is usually during O/S install, when both CD ROM and
Disk drives are churning durnig data transfer, I get the lockup.
I'm getting ready to have the vendor RMA the boards (since they are under
warranty).

<pre><font>Versions 1.0 and 1.1 of the BP6 had a small 100uF capacitor at the edge
of the mb between the two CPUs (EC10).  Mine were black.

I've replaced this with a 1000uF, 16v from Radio Shack on both rev 1.0
and 1.1 boards with 100% success.  This board also requires a good 300W
or higher power supply (eg- SPI, Enermax).

Before the capacitor fix, large disk to disk file copies would lock up
hard requireing power cycle.
