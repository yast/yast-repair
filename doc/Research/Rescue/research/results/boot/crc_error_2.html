I've recently upgraded my system, and decided to put Linux on it, but
I'm getting some serious errors, possibly hardware related.

I've tried installing both Slackware and Redhat, but I'm getting
similar installation problems with both of them: I made my boot and
image disks, but sooner or later, on either installation, I lose the
Linux boot--I've been getting CRC and corruption errors as the Linux
boot decompresses.  Once in a while I'll get lucky and make it into Linux,
but not often.  Most of the time I either have to reboot or the system
reboots itself.

I've tried starting off a Linux boot disk, but that doesn't work. (Same
problem, even after making new boot/root disks).

I'm guessing that it may be a hardware problem, since I have been
lucky and made it through without a corrupt crc only twice, out of about
30-50 attempts.  (I also get page faults, general protection errors, and
unexpected reboots often on Windows 95 since I upgraded, even though I
have re-installed windows.  Windows 95 doesn't report any hardware conflicts
or problems.)

Here's my configuration:

Cyix 6x86 P150+, 32 mb EDO RAM, no external cache (yet)
Trition III motherboard, Award plug-and play BIOS extension, etc.
Diamond Stealth 64 DRAM, 1mb (will upgrade to 2mb soon)
16bit Nimble (Opti chipset) soundblaster

1.7 G IBM HD (mode 4) on IDE channel 1 (master)
  1.1 G VFAT partition
   .6 G VFAT partition

406 mb Conner HD (mode 1) on IDE channel 2 (master)
   32 mb Linux Swap
  374 mb Linux Native partition

Hitachi 4x CD-ROM, on IDE channel 2 (slave)


Here's what I've done so far:

I first tried to install redhat using the redhat.exe on the infomagic
distribution (April 96, redhat picasso).  Redhat.exe wouldn't work,
because it said I had a memory conflict at 90000h-9ffffh (right below
640k).  No matter how I changed my boot configuration in (booted off a
clean disk, looked at programs in memory, etc.), I couldn't get it to run.

So I tried slackware.  I installed slackware completely using a boot and

 I'm pretty new at this myself, but I had the same CRC problems when I 
first tried to Install Slackware on my 486. It would always hang up in 
the middle of the kernel decompression from the floppy.
 I tried a lot of things, and finally forced the PC to boot up in low 
speed CPU mode, and it worked ! I passed the booting process. Then you 
have to install the minimum to start from the hard drive without using 
the floppies, change the speed back to high, and that's it.

 I believe it has something to do with the IDE controller or the way data 
is transfered from the floppy. I tried using a 5''1/4 as A: to boot from, 
but it was the same thing.

 Hope that works for you,


Chris.

	The first thing I would try would be to disable Plug and Pray in the
BIOS (while your there, make sure everything is set up correctly).  After
that check your dip switch settigns on the motherboard and make sure that
they match your configuration.  I've seen plenty of Motherboard shipped
from the factory with settings that don't match what's actually installed.
After that start taking out individual pieces of hardware and see what
happens.  Even try removing 16 megs of memory.

	Your motherboard may just be bad.

I have a similar problem on a system which I have recently upgraded to
a 2.0.x kernel.  However, it works fine under 1.2.13.  Can I suggest that
you try booting using an older kernel.  If it works, its not a complete
solution, but its better than nothing.

Paul, This might be a bit of a Red herring for your problem but the only time
I've had this sort of problem where Linux consistantly gave a CRC error whilst
decompressing the kernel was a mystery problem after the last power outage
we had here last month. When I got to work the next day one of my Linux machines
would not reboot, reporting CRC errors every time. I decided that the disk had been
corrupted after some testing and tried one of my boot floppies with the same result.
That confused the hell out of me! and I floundered for a few hours trying to work it out.
DOS worked when I booted from a floopy, but I never did more than a few basic commands,
assuming it was OK from the fact it booted OK. Then, hours later, I decided to start pulling 
it all apart and try to test some of the hardware when I noticed the CPU fan was not spining.
Fool I am went straight to give it a little manual assistance with my finger and S%^T ITS HOT!!.
It seems the 66MHz Pentium (5V and many Watts!) was overheating and the arithmetic in the CRC check
was seeing this in the form of timing problems in the CPU. I grabed for the cooling spray,
and booted whilst destroying the ozone layer! No problems, CPU had survived. I replaced
that fan with one from &quot;CPU POWER AND COOLING INC&quot; who's fans have a 5 year waranty and real 
bearings. (Recomended for both Pentium and PentiumPro fans - from experience)
What this might mean to you I don't know apart from the CRC calculation exersizing critical
CPU timing paths. PERHAPS the motherboard has performance related timing configured wrong
for your Cyrix CPU?

Hi.  I had the same problem.  It pretty much keeps the machine
from booting.  It solved itself.  The problem occurred more
and more frequently until the drive started making strange
noises.  Then, the drive made a really loud noise and shorted
out the power.  It would not come up after that.  Putting in
new SCSI drives solved the problem.
