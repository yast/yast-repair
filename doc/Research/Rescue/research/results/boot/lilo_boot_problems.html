<strong>Applies to</strong><p>
<strong>Kernel</strong>: Versions since 2.0<br>
<p><h3>Problem</h3>
When booting with LILO problems appear after the kernel was loaded :-(
<p>
It is possible to choose a kernel and this kernel will be loaded then
(some dots appear). However starting this kernel doesn't work.
This means : The system crashes with a couple of different reactions
before the message <code>uncompresing Linux</code> appears on the screen.
<p>
Possible error messages and phenomena :
<ul>
<li> System reboots
<li> System simply freezes
<li> crc-error
<li> no free space
<li> Error 0x00
<li> Error 0x01
<li> incomplete literal tree
</ul>

Afterwards the floppy might be accessed from time to time,
however the system is halted.

<h3>Cause </h3>
The cause for this is a combination of huge kernels, LILO and faulty hardware.
Approximately 1 % of the machines is affected.
<p>
We suspect that a faulty BIOS has problems with fast memory access.
<p>
The problem does <strong>not</strong> appear, if
<ul>
<p>
<li> the computer is booted with Loadlin, 
<p>
<li> the kernel is e.g. copied with <code>dd if=/vmlinuz 
of=/dev/fd0</code> to a floppy and is directly loaded from there,
<p>
<li> a smaller kernel, which was built with <code>make zImage</code> 
(e.g. an older 1.2.13 kernel) is booted with LILO.
</ul>

Machines with the following BIOS settings could also be booted without problems:
<ul>
<li> Disabled Internal Cache
<li> <code>DRAM Precharge Wait State</code> set to 1 <strong>and</strong><br>
<code>DRAM Wait Burst Timing</code> to 0x3333
</ul>

<h3>Solution</h3>
First it must be possible to install a system. If you cannot
boot directly with Loadlin (or Setup.exe), you should initially 
an old 1.2.13 bootdisk use for the installation. If you do not have 
one available, rearrange the BIOS parameters.
<p>
After a successful installation the question arises, how one can boot
the system. First one boots with the same medium as for the installation. 
There is no problems with using loadlin from a DOS partition.
If you use a bootdisk then use the following parameters :
<pre>
        load_ramdisk=0 root=/dev/???
</pre>
where ??? is your root partition.
<p>
Afterwards you should immediately generate a new kernel
since this can then be booted with LILO.
<p>
If you have further questions about this, please send us 
the complete specification of your mainboard and your BIOS
enclosed with your mail.
