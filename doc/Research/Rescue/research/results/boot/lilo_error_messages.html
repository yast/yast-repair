<h3>Symptom:</h3>
When booting with LILO, the machine hangs after displaying a part of the 
word <code>LILO</code> on the screen.

<h3>Interpretation</h3>
<p>
The LILO start-up code consists of two parts : The "first stage" in a bootsector and the 
"second stage" in <code>/boot/boot.b</code>. During the installation of LILO a "map-file" is
created (ususllay <code>/boot/map</code>), where LILO finds the necessary pointers (sector-adresses)
to the operating systems (Linux-Kernel etc.) that should be started.

<p>
(The following is taken from section 5.2.1 of the original LILO User's Guide by LILO-author 
Werner Almesberger)
<p>

When LILO loads itself, it displays the word 
<pre>
LILO
</pre>
Each letter is printed before or after performing some specific action. 
If LILO fails at some point, the letters printed so far can be used to 
identify the problem.

<p>
<ul> 
   <li> <code>(nothing)</code>
     <p> 
     No part of LILO has been loaded. Either LILO isn't installed
     or the partition on which its boot sector is located isn't active.
   <p>
   <li> <code>L error</code> 
     <p>
     The first stage boot loader has been loaded and started, but it can't load 
     the second stage boot loader. The two-digit error codes indicate the type of 
     problem. This condition usually indicates a media failure or a geometry 
     mismatch.
   <p>
   <li> <code>LI</code> 
     <p>     
     The first stage boot loader was able to load the second stage boot loader, 
     but has failed to execute it. This can either be caused by a geometry mismatch 
     or by moving <code>/boot/boot.b</code> without running the map installer.
   <p>
   <li> <code>LIL</code> 
     <p>
     The second stage boot loader has been started, but it can't load the descriptor 
     table from the map file. This is typically caused by a media failure or by a 
     geometry mismatch.
   <p>
   <li> <code>LIL?</code>
     <p>
     The second stage boot loader has been loaded at an incorrect address. This is 
     typically caused by a subtle geometry mismatch or by moving /boot/boot.b without 
     running the map installer.
   <p>
   <li><code>LIL-</code> 
     <p>
     The descriptor table is corrupt.  This can either be caused by a geometry mismatch 
     or by moving <code>/boot/map</code> without running the map installer.
   <p>
   <li><code>LILO</code> 
   <p>
   All parts of LILO have been successfully loaded.
</ul>

<p>
The most frequent causes for a geometry mismatch are not physical defects or
invalid partition tables but errors during the installation of LILO. Often these
are caused by ignoring the <A href="1024_Zylinder.html">
1024 cylinder boundary (1024_Zylinder.html)</A>.

<p>
<h3>Solution :</h3>
<p>
In most cases the solution is to apply one of the three procedures given
below :
<p>
<ul>
<li> Install the LILO data below the 1024 cylinder boundary (if not yet 
     done). This includes installing the necessary Linux kernel(s) as well 
     as the files stored in  <code>/boot</code> and the boot sector which
     will contain LILO's start-up code.
     <p>

<li> Reinstall LILO by means of the command
     <pre>
     /sbin/lilo
     </pre>

     <em>Tip:</em><code>/sbin/lilo</code> can provide a detailed log
         if you enhance verbosity and re-direct the output to
         appropriate logfiles. To do so, proceed like this:
         <a name=lilo-logs></a>
     <pre>
          /sbin/lilo -v -v -v >/boot/lilo.log 2>/boot/lilo.logerr
     </pre>
     
     <code>/boot/lilo.logerr</code> should contain nothing at all (if the
     boot configuration is correct). <code>/boot/lilo.log</code> will 
     (among others) tell you precisely which geometries and BIOS device 
     numbers LILO will be going to use.
     <p>

<li> Check the consistency of hard disk geometry information. Actually,
     such information is stored in up to <em>four</em> places:
     <ul>
     <li> geometry used by LILO. <br>
          <em>See:</em> <a href=#lilo-logs>the logs described above.</a><br>
          <em>Adjustable by: </em> <code>disk =</code> option for 
          <code>lilo.conf </code>. Cf. the LILO section in your 
          SuSE Linux manual, the original LILO documentation, or   
          <a href=ke_eide-scsi.html>
          http://sdb.suse.de/sdb/en/html/ke_eide-scsi.html</a>. 
     <li> geometry detected/used by the Linux kernel. <br>
          <em>See:</em> the boot messages 
          (<code>/var/log/boot.msg</code> or (maybe) the output
          of the <code>dmesg</code> command).<br>
          <em>Adjustable by: </em> suitable kernel parameters (to some extent).
          Details e.g in your SuSE  Linux manual.
     <li> geometry stored in the partition table.<br>
          <em>See:</em> Output of <code>/sbin/fdisk -l</code>.<br>
          <em>Adjustable by: </em>  <code>fdisk</code> 
          Expert commands. <b>Very dangerous</b> for your data! 
          Previous full backup strongly recommended! Really for
          experts only!
     <li> geometry used by the BIOS. LILO will meet this geometry later
          at each system startup and must cope with it.<br>
          <em>See:</em> BIOS-Setup (also that for your SCSI host adapter).<br>
          <em>Adjustable by: </em> BIOS-Setup.
     </ul>
<p>

     In case of inconsistencies the "way of least resistance" will
often be the best method for adjustment.

</ul>

<h3>Data for support:</h3>

<p>
When you contact any kind of support about LILO, your chances
for success will be <em>significantly</em> better (in light of
the preceding), if you include the following into your request:
<p>

<ol>
    <li><code>/etc/lilo.conf</code>,
    <li>output of the command <code>fdisk -l</code> (partition layout),
    <li><a href=#lilo-logs>the LILO logs</a> referred to above,
    <li>BIOS and SCSI BIOS settings concerning your hard disks.
</ol>
<p>

Of course, it might well be that the mere act of collecting these
data is enough to set you onto the right track <tt>;-)</tt>
