<h3>Symptom:</h3>

When trying to boot your <strong>S.u.S.E. Linux</strong> system, the booting process stops 
with a message like
<pre>
Kernel Panic: VFS: couldn't mount root
</pre>

It is important to know, when this occurs: 

<ol>
<p>
<li> During the installation
<p>
<li> During the installation, at the end of the booting process
<p>
<li> In the running system
<p>
<li> After the creation of a new kernel
</ol>

The following list of possible causes will refer to these topics. 
There will also be hints on articles that might provide a possible 
solution in these situations.

<ul>
<p>
<li> (1/2/3/4) You have a SCSI system. The root partition is located on a SCSI drive.
The SCSI controller isn't recognized by the running kernel.
<p>
This is the likely cause if the kernel displays a message like the following at boot-time :
<pre>
scsi: 0 hosts
</pre>

<p>

<li> (1/2) When booting from CD during the installation the specified CD-ROM drive 
isn't recognized. The previous topic might also apply, if it is a SCSI CD-ROM. When
loading the Rootimage from CD the latter isn't recognized and the system hangs.
<p>
<h3>Solution :</h3>
<p>
Make sure you entered the necessary kernel parameters correctly (if these are needed). Especially the values for
IRQ and port adress are important.

<p>
<li>(3/4) The bootmanager <strong>LILO</strong> wasn't configured correctly. The root-partition
specified in the file <code>/etc/lilo.conf</code> isn't correct.
<p>
<h3>Solution :</h3>
<p>
Boot the system with the bootdisk that comes with the S.u.S.E. Linux distribution or
- even better - the bootdisk that was created during the installation. In the first case,
after having loaded the necessary modules, choose the menu item <code>Boot installed system</code>.
This way you can boot from your root partition. If this fails, please read the articles
<p>
<a href="linuxrc.html">Booten von der S.u.S.E. Boot-Diskette</a>.<br>
<a href="kfr_47.html">Notfalldiskette erstellen</a>
<p>
Once you're in the system, change the file <code>/etc/lilo.conf</code> such that it contains
the correct root partition. Enter the command <code>lilo</code> and reboot the system in order
to test the configuration.
<p>
For further information see the article <a href="1024_Zylinder.html">Linux über 1024 Zylinder</a>
<p>
<li>(3/4) When starting Linux from DOS using the Linux loader <strong>loadlin</strong>
(resp. <code>linux.bat</code>), a wrong parameter for the root partition is specified. 
It is also possible, that there is a wrong root partition in the file <code>c:\loadlin\linux.par</code> .
<p>
<h3>Solution :</h3>
<p>
Please only specify the device-name WITHOUT leading <code>/dev/</code> in <code>LINUX.BAT</code>, e.g.
<pre>
c:\loadlin> linux hda5 
</pre>
<p>

<p>
<li> (4) During the reconfiguration and recompilation of the kernel no support for SCSI Low-Level 
drivers and/or SCSI discs was chosen or it was only activated as a module.
<p>
<h3>Solution :</h3>
<p>
In SCSI systems both the SCSI disk support and the low level drivers must be compiled
directly into the kernel and may not be compiled as a module.
<p>
Therefore : Boot the system with the bootdisk that comes with S.u.S.E. Linux or - even better -
the bootdisk that was created during the installation. In the first case, after having loaded the 
necessary modules, choose the menu item <code>Boot installed system</code>. This way you can boot 
from your root partition.
<p>
Now reconfigure, compile and install the kernel (see manual).
<p>
<li>(4) During the reconfiguration and recompilation of the kernel no support for (E)IDE
and/or EIDE drives was chosen.
<p>
<h3>Solution :</h3>
<p>
Please procede like in the previous topic and choose support for EIDE devices. 
<p>
<li>(4) During the reconfiguration and recompilation of the kernel no support for 
the ELF binary format was chosen or this support was only activated as a module.

<h3>Solution :</h3>
<p>
Boot the system with the bootdisk that comes with S.u.S.E. Linux or - even better -
the bootdisk that was created during the installation. In the first case, after having loaded the 
necessary modules, choose the menu item <code>Boot installed system</code>. This way you can boot 
from your root partition.
<p>
Compile and install a kernel, that has support for the ELF binary format. This support may 
<strong>NOT</strong> be activated as a module !
<p>
<li>(4) During the reconfiguration and recompilation of the kernel no support for 
the EXT2 filesystem was chosen or this support was only activated as a module.

<h3>Solution :</h3>
<p>
Boot the system with the bootdisk that comes with S.u.S.E. Linux or - even better -
the bootdisk that was created during the installation. In the first case, after having loaded the 
necessary modules, choose the menu item <code>Boot installed system</code>. This way you can boot 
from your root partition.
<p>
Compile and install a kernel, that has support for the EXT2 filesystem. This support may 
<strong>NOT</strong> be activated as a module !
<p>
<li> (3/4) After the recompilation of the kernel <code>/etc/lilo.conf</code> wasn't updated
or <strong>lilo</strong> wasn't executed. As a result the correct kernel won't be started or
the wrong root partition is being used.
<p>
<h3>Solution :</h3>
<p>
Whenever you copy a new kernel to the Root-directory <code>/</code>,
<code>lilo</code> <strong>MUST</strong> be executed. Otherwise it won't
find the new kernel. If the new kernel has a name, that is not yet listed 
in <code>/etc/lilo.conf</code>, you will also have to adapt this file.
<p>
Boot the system with the bootdisk that comes with S.u.S.E. Linux or - even better -
the bootdisk that was created during the installation. In the first case, after having loaded the 
necessary modules, choose the menu item <code>Boot installed system</code>. This way you can boot 
from your root partition.
<p>
Make sure that <code>/etc/lilo.conf</code> fits your needs, then execute <code>lilo</code>.
<p>
<li> (1/2/3/4) There is a failure of the hardware of your SCSI controller, the EIDE controller
or the harddisk (This is unlikely, though).
<p>
An indication for such failures are frequent read-/write-errors or defective boot sectors. 
<p>
<h3>Solution :</h3>
<p>
If one of the devices is really broken, the only solution is to replace it.
